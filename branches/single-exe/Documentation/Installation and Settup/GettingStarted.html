            <h1>
                Basic Instructions</h1>
    <h2>
        Installing the Binaries</h2>
    <p>
        The binaries are available on SourceForge in a <i>zip</i> file. If you unzip 
        this file you will get 4 folders <i>Nova/Component Editor, Nova/Console Nova/Race
        Designer </i><span class="style1">&nbsp;and&nbsp; the </span><i>Nova GUI</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        In each folder you will find a <i>.exe or application</i> file. Running it will run the
        program of the same name. There is no need to install/uninstall the programs. 
    <p>
        Note that this version of the <i>Nova</i> binaries require that .Net version 3 
        is installed. This is a free download from the Microsoft website. If you are 
        using Windows Update you will already have received it automatically.</p>
    <p>
        You may place the Nova folder anywhere you wish, but when you first run Nova you will get an error message because you will
        need to tell it where you placed it's files. Hopefully a future version will be smart enough to check the
        obvious places first, but for now you will need to give it a hand. After you do 
        this the first time, Nova will remember where the files are located, by using
        the windows registry.</p>
        
    <p>
        Runing the applications in the following order will ensure that the windows registry keys are set for each aplication and 
        should prevent errors.</p>
        
        <h2> Component Editor </h2>
    <p>
        To start with, open the <i>Nova/Component Editor</i> folder and run the application <i>Component Editor.exe</i>
        this program is used for browsing (or even modifying) the Nova design components (or technology tree)</p>

    <h2>
        Components.xml</h2>
    <p>
        Nova needs a file that defines the available design components. By default it's in the top-level folder
        of the <em>Nova </em>directory and is called <i>components.xml</i>. Select the file and click the <i>Open</i> button.</p>
    <h2>Graphics</h2>

    <p>
            Next Nova needs to know where the Graphics images are located. They should be in <i>Nova/Graphics</i>.
            Highlight the Graphics folder in the tree view and click the <i>OK</i> button. You should now be able to
            browse the design components. When you are done with the component editor, close it and move on to making a race.</p>

            <h2>
                Create One or More Races</h2>
            First, the Race Designer must be ran to create a race to play.&nbsp; Once the race
            has been designed and the <em>Generate</em> button has been pressed you will be
            prompted for a folder to hold all files related to the game. The <em>Nova</em> GUI
            program can currently only play one game at a time and it will automatically use
            the folder you specify in the Race Designer.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to play a "test" game you can create as many races as you like. You
            will find things simpler to manage if you select the same folder for all races you
            create (it will save you copying files around).<br>
            <h2>
                Create a Game</h2>
            Next, run the Console program and press the<em> New Game</em> button. If no folder
            has been specified before then, again, you will be prompted for one. If you are
            running a test game then specify the same one given in the Race Designer as it will
            save the need to copy turn files around.<br>
            <h2>
                Create a Player Turn</h2>
            Then just start the GUI and create a turn. A turn file is created whenever you exit
            the GUI so there is no explicit save or submit commands as there are in <em>Stars!</em><form runat="server">
                <h2>
                Generate a New Year Turn</h2>
    </form>
        <form runat="server">
            Then it's a case of starting up the <em>Nova Console</em> and pressing the <em>Generate
                Turn </em>button to create the game turn for the next year and then re-running
            the GUI to generate the next player turn. These last two steps are performed until
            the end of the game.<br>
            <br>
        </form>
            <form runat="server">
                Game Folders</form>
        <form runat="server">
            <p>
                It is a design aim that all game persistent game data, including that of multiple
                races, can exist in a single folder on a single PC and accessed by a single user
                name. This allows a convenient method of debugging the programs (or playing practice
                games) without having to copy files between folders or log in and out to switch
                user names to play different races in a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are potentially two folders: the one used for the player's game files (used
                by the <em>Race Designer</em> and the <em>Nova GUI</em>) and one used by the <em>Nova
                    Console</em> game files.</p>
            <p>
                The first program that must be run is the <em>Race Designer</em> and it will gather
                (implicitly) the name of the player's game folder when the <em>Generate Race </em>
                feature is selected and the where to save the race definition file is specified
                in the <em>Save File</em> dialog . This folder name is saved in the Windows Registry
                (for the current user) and picked up automatically by the <em>Nova GUI </em>when
                it starts<em> </em>so it need not be requested from the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Nova Console</em> also needs a game folder to keep its data. It cannot use
                the one specified by the <em>Race Designer</em> in the Registry as it may, and typically
                will, be running on a different PC so a folder to use must be explicitly prompted
                for (using the Windows <em>Browse Folder </em>dialog). However, if the <em>Nova Console
                </em>is running on the same PC as a game player, the player's game directory can
                be selected as the one to use. This removes the need to copy turn data files from
                one place to the other. Once the console game folder has been selected it is saved
                (in the console state data file) and not asked for again<br>
            </p>
