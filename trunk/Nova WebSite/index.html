   <h2>
       Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Nova</em> is a <i>simple</i> clone of the (discontinued) game <em>Stars!</em>. It was
        created as a "hobby" excuse to learn C#, .Net and web technologies. It is a playable
        game but has nowhere near the features of the later versions of
        <em>Stars</em>!&nbsp; and, at the moment,
        &nbsp;there is very little in the way of documentation (but that is also a "hobby"
        excuse to learn about web building as all documentation is being put together using
        a local web site).</p>
    <p>
        You can find out more about <em>Stars!<link href="StyleSheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /></em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars!">

    <p>
        If you've been to this site before and want to know what's new you'll find details
        <a href="WhatsNew.html">here</a> (last updated on the 
        <span style="color: fuchsia">18th of July <span> 2008</span></span>).</p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-family: Arial"><strong></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial">
         Basically, I wanted to learn C# and how to build web
         sites (all they let me do at work these days is write documents so I decided I needed
         a "hobby"). I've always been a great fan of the game <em>Stars!</em> so I thought I'd try
         and put together a small clone of the game just for a bit of fun and as
          an "excuse" to learn the details of .Net.</span></p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-family: Arial">Due to having a "real life" to get on with it's been pretty much an on-off project grabbing a few
         minutes here and there (mostly
          on the train as I travel to and from work) but the guts of the game are done and, basically, it is now a playable
          game (although it doesn't have the full functionality of <em>Stars!</em>). </span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-family: Arial"></span>
      <span style="font-family: Arial">Ships can be designed and built, planets
         can be explored and colonised, cargo can be moved from A-to-B, populations grow,
         mines generate minerals, races can be designed, battles can be fought, planets can be bombed, invaded, etc. In fact, what started out as a simple hobby exercise has grown
          into a </span><span style="font-family: Arial">playable game. Pretty close to the very
              first version of <em>Stars!</em>.</span></p>
