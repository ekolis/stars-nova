    This is the main console or server program. It only has two functions: Generate
    a fresh new game and generate the turns for each subsequent year. The console program
    generates a single "turn file" which is distributed to all game players. This file
    is read by the <em>Nova</em> GUI program to allow each player to see the state of
    the game.<br />
    <br />
    Each player generates his turn for the next year which are all gathered into a single
    place where the console program uses them to generate the turn for the next year.<br />
    <br />
    Consequently, having only two functions, the program appears very simple to the
    user but it actually contains most of the "guts" behind the game play. Here is
    a screen shot:<br />

    When a new game is started there is the expected dialog to define the victory conditions:<br />
