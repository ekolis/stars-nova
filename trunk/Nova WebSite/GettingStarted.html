            <h1>
                Basic Instructions</h1>
    <h2>
        Installing the Binaries</h2>
    <p>
        The binaries are available on SourceForge in a <i>zip</i> file. If you unzip 
        this file you will get 4 folders <i>Nova/Component Editor, Nova Console Race 
        Designer </i><span class="style1">&nbsp;and&nbsp; the </span><i>Nova GUI</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        In each folder you will find a <i>setup.exe</i> file. Running it will install 
        the program of the same name. Programs can be uninstalled from the Control Panel 
        just like any other application. In the top-level Nova folder you will find a 
        copy of this page plus a file <i>called components.dat</i>. What to do with that 
        file is described in the next section.</p>
    <p>
        Once you have installed the programs and placed <i>components.dat</i> in a 
        location of your choice you may delete the <i>Nova</i> installation folder if 
        you should so wish.</p>
    <p>
        Note that this version of the <i>Nova</i> binaries require that .Net version 3 
        is installed. This is a free download from the Microsoft website. If you are 
        using Windows Update you will already have received it automatically.</p>
    <h2>
        Components.dat</h2>
    <p>
        At the moment the programs need to be able to find a file that defines the 
        available design components. If you have never ran <em>Nova</em> before run the 
        Component Editor and it will ask where to find it &nbsp;(it&#39;s in the top-level folder 
        of the <em>Nova </em>source code in the top-level unzipped binaries). After 
        that, &nbsp;the location will be recorded in the Registry and used automatically from 
        then on. You can place this file anywhere you like.</p>
            <h2>
                Create One or More Races</h2>
            First, the Race Designer must be ran to create a race to play.&nbsp; Once the race
            has been designed and the <em>Generate</em> button has been pressed you will be
            prompted for a folder to hold all files related to the game. The <em>Nova</em> GUI
            program can currently only play one game at a time and it will automatically use
            the folder you specify in the Race Designer.<br />
            <br />
            If you want to play a "test" game you can create as many races as you like. You
            will find things simpler to manage if you select the same folder for all races you
            create (it will save you copying files around).<br />
            <h2>
                Create a Game</h2>
            Next, run the Console program and press the<em> New Game</em> button. If no folder
            has been specified before then, again, you will be prompted for one. If you are
            running a test game then specify the same one given in the Race Designer as it will
            save the need to copy turn files around.<br />
            <h2>
                Create a Player Turn</h2>
            Then just start the GUI and create a turn. A turn file is created whenever you exit
            the GUI so there is no explicit save or submit commands as there are in <em>Stars!</em><form runat="server">
                <h2>
                Generate a New Year Turn</h2>
    </form>
        <form runat="server">
            Then it's a case of starting up the <em>Nova Console</em> and pressing the <em>Generate
                Turn </em>button to create the game turn for the next year and then re-running
            the GUI to generate the next player turn. These last two steps are performed until
            the end of the game.<br />
            <br />
        </form>
            <form runat="server">
                Game Folders</form>
        <form runat="server">
            <p>
                It is a design aim that all game persistent game data, including that of multiple
                races, can exist in a single folder on a single PC and accessed by a single user
                name. This allows a convenient method of debugging the programs (or playing practice
                games) without having to copy files between folders or log in and out to switch
                user names to play different races in a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are potentially two folders: the one used for the player's game files (used
                by the <em>Race Designer</em> and the <em>Nova GUI</em>) and one used by the <em>Nova
                    Console</em> game files.</p>
            <p>
                The first program that must be run is the <em>Race Designer</em> and it will gather
                (implicitly) the name of the player's game folder when the <em>Generate Race </em>
                feature is selected and the where to save the race definition file is specified
                in the <em>Save File</em> dialog . This folder name is saved in the Windows Registry
                (for the current user) and picked up automatically by the <em>Nova GUI </em>when
                it starts<em> </em>so it need not be requested from the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Nova Console</em> also needs a game folder to keep its data. It cannot use
                the one specified by the <em>Race Designer</em> in the Registry as it may, and typically
                will, be running on a different PC so a folder to use must be explicitly prompted
                for (using the Windows <em>Browse Folder </em>dialog). However, if the <em>Nova Console
                </em>is running on the same PC as a game player, the player's game directory can
                be selected as the one to use. This removes the need to copy turn data files from
                one place to the other. Once the console game folder has been selected it is saved
                (in the console state data file) and not asked for again<br />
