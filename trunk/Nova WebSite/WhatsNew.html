    <h2 title="Nova - What's New">
        15th of June 2008</h2>
        <i>Nova </i>now&nbsp;supports minefields. You can see screen shots   <a href="Minefields.html">here</a>.<h2>
        26th of April 2008</h2>
<p>
        I&#39;ve switched to the 2008 versions of the free Visual Studio Express tools. If 
        you want to work with the <i>Nova</i> source code you will need to upgrade (it&#39;s worth it, the new 
        programs have some nice features).</p>
<p>
        As implied above, <i>Nova</i> now requires version 3 of .Net. This is a 
        free download from the Microsoft website if you have not already received 
        it through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
        The effects of missile accuracy have now been added.
<p>
        Energy Capacitor and Flux Capacitor have been added to the Component Designer 
        and the components file (although they currently have no effect in the game.</p>
<p>
        Cargo capacity is now implemented as a module like any other component (it 
        simplified the code).</p>
    <h2>
        Date 3rd January 2008</h2>
    <p>
        Passwords are now required to access a player's game data. When a race is created
        a password is required. Unlike <em>Stars! </em>a single turn file is sent to all
        game players. You will need this password to access your portion of the generated
        turn file. If you forget it you will no longer be able to play in the game. The
        password is case sensitive.</p>
    <p>
        The effects of beam weapon disipation have now been added in.</p>
    <h2>
        13th13th of November 2007</h2>
    <p>
        The documentation pages (what little there are) have all been converted to HTML
        (from aspx).<br />
        A new dialog has been added to the Component Editor</em> to define mine-layers.<br />
        The <em>Maximum Population Growth </em>parameter has been implemented.<br />
        There is now a <em>Scores </em>report. See the example at the bottom of the 
        <a href="Reports.html#Scores">
            reports page</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        6th of November</h2>
    <p>
        Just for now, I've stopped using NUnit for unit tests. It was causing some strange
        dependencies. My own fault. I had a bit to learn about using the tool.<br />
        <br />
        The <em>Race Designer </em>will now let you load a race file to look at and modify
        race files
        (only your
        own).&nbsp; Once subitted to a game, changes will have no effect. I consider the <em>Race Designer</em>&nbsp; completed and happy to receive
        any bug reports on it<br />
        <br />
        Race files can now optionally have a password to reload them. I can't see any reason
        to use this fetaure but there was stuff about encyption I wanted to learn.</p>
    <h2>
        27th of August 2007</h2>
    <p>
        Some new dialogs have been added to the <em>Component Designer.<br />
        </em>There is now a binary download of <em>Nova </em>(see <em>SourceForge).</em></p>
    <h2>
        15th of August 2007</h2>
    <p>
        A new dialog has been added to the <em>Component Designer</em> for (most) electrical components.<br />
        Web screen shots have now been taken under Vista (although <em>Nova</em> still works
        under XP).<br />
        Individual battle steps are now recorded&nbsp; and stored in the global turn file.<br />
        There is now a battle visualisation dialog in the <em>Nova GUI </em>(but not yet
        in its final form) to step through a battle.<br />
        You can now go straight to the battle visualisation dialog from the message panel
        saying there was a battle.<br />
        Program documentation has been transformed from ASP to simple XHTML (easier for
        many people to read).<br />
        The project is now compatible with the full Visual Studio 2005 program as well as
        the (free) Express versions.<br />
        The various dialogs now have the same set of minimise and maximise options (mostly
        none).</p>
    <h2>
       29th of April &nbsp;2007</h2>
    <p>
        The primary racial trait <em>Hyper-Expansion</em> has been implemented (see the
        updated <a href="RaceDesigner.html">screen shot</a>).<b)<br />
        The game parameter Minimum Game Time</em> has now been implemented.&nbsp;<br />
        The <em>Player's Planets </em>and <em>Player's Fleets </em>reports have now been implemented (see the <a href="Reports.html">
            screen shots</a>).<br />
        The <em>
        Fielded Kelarium</em> armour now contributes to a ship's shield strength.<br />
        The<em> Croby Shamor</em> Shield now contributes  Shield now contributes to a ship's armour strength.<br />
        Shift+Drag in the ship designer dialog will now add up to 10 modules to a hull module slot.go capacity is now implemented as a native hull feature rather than as a
        hull component as was done previously.<br />
        The <em>Next </em>and <em>Previous</em> buttons for the fleet and planet displays
        are now in the same relative position on the screen.<br />
        Planet production queues now work just like in <em>Stars!</em>&nbsp; (previously
        you needed all resources in one go to manufacture an item).<br />
       A plasma-type effect has now been added to the star map display in the <em>Nova GUI</em>.<br />
       Scanner range displays are now semi-transparent to allow a little of the new background
       to show through.<br />
        The <em>Nova</em> <em>GUI</em> screenshots on this website have been updated to
        refelect the new layout (see the <a href="MainWindow.html">screen shots</a>).</p>
    <p>
        The report screens use the new (.Net 2.0) &nbsp;<em>DataGridView </em>control so
        columns are automatically resized to suit the size of the report dialog. Also, report
        columns can be dragged by the user into any order they would like to see. For example,
        the last column of the fleet report (<em>Mass</em>) could be dragged to be the second
        column, next to the fleet name. By the way, there are two problems with the reports:
        the headers are not centred correctly and there is a blank line at the bottom of
        each report). If there are any <em>DataGridView</em> experts who can tell me how
        to fix these issues please e-mail me.</p>
    <p>
       Until now, <em>Nova</em> has really only been suitable for use by people with software
        skills that can build it from the source code. However, it is now sufficiently stable
        that it is not far away from being able to be released in binary form so that non-developers
        can play with it. Text has been added to the <em>Nova</em> home page to mention
  home page to mention
        this and I hope this will be available in a June release. If not, the binary
        release should be available by July (pre-Alpha).</p>
