      Component Designer</h1>
   <p>
      Defining all the components (scanners, engines, etc.) was turning out to be a bit tedious so, as
      a development tool, a component designer has been implemented to create
       the components that are
      used in the game.&nbsp; It is really just a simple Windows
       application that provides a convenient way of populating and updating the simple
       data structures that define the various game components. This is the main screen
       that provides the "jumping off" point to the individual dialogs for each component
       type that can be created: </p>
    <p>
        <img src="./Graphics/ComponentDesigner0.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Probably the most complicated component is the ship (or starbase) hull and here
        is a screen shot of a hull (Battleship) &nbsp;being created. Not obvious from
        this screen shot is the fact that the component types held by each hull module are
        defined using a right-click pop-up menu.</p>
   <p>
      <img src="./Graphics/ComponentDesigner1.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        All of the other components are much simpler to define and the dialogs are almost
        identical. Each dialog consists of some sections common to all components, for example
        required technology levels, build cost, etc. and then anything specific to the component
        type. For example, here is an example of an armour component being created:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="./Graphics/ComponentDesigner2.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        To show the similarity between the other dialogs here is an example of a beam weapon
        (Anti-matter Pulverizer) being created:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="./Graphics/ComponentDesigner3.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        It's important to remember that this is just a development tool. It would not normally
        be used unless someone wanted to create new components or modify the characteristics
        of existing ones.</p>
