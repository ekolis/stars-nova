   <h1>
      Main Window</h1>
   <p>
       This is the main <em>Nova </em>main window early in a new game. As you
       can see it is very similar to the main <em>Stars!</em> screen apart from the fact
       that it relies on the screen area being (at least) 1024x768. The race being played
       is <em>Hyper-Expansion</em> and, indeed, at this point the race is expanding from
       its home planet. The race has not yet done enough research to obtain long-range
      scanners
       and only has the <em>Bat</em> scanner and a ship has to be in orbit to scan for
       ships and planet resources. This is the case for <em>Hydrogen</em> which has been
       determined to be colonised by another race. There has been a battle at <em>Hydrogen</em>&nbsp;
       and this race was the victor.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;<img src="./Graphics/GUI1.jpg" alt="Screen Shot" /></p>
    <p>
        <br />
        In the top left of the screen is the selected item detail panel. In this case it
        is showing the details of the home world but it will switch to showing the details
        of a fleet should one be selected.</p>
    <p>
        In the middle left is the usual game message area and in the bottom left is the
        summary panel. Again, this is showing the summary of the home planet but will switch
        to a fleet summary when one is selected.</p>
    <p>
        Over to the right is the star map that works exactly like the one in <em>Stars!. </em>
        However, only buttons for zooming in and out and turning on and off the star names
        have been implemented so far.</p>
    <p>
        Next is an screen shot of the same state of the game seen from another race. This
        race is <em>JOAT</em> and has long-range and penetrating scanners and can see enemy
        ships approaching <em>LGM 3</em>. This race lost the battle at <em>Hydrogen</em>
        as is reported in the message screen.</p>
   <p>
        <img src="./Graphics/GUI2.jpg" alt = "Screen shot" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        In this view the planet names have been turned off to give a less cluttered display.
        Also, note that a new button has appeared in the message panel: <em>Go To</em>.
        If the message relates to some complex event then pressing this button will pop
        up a dialog to show the details. In this example, there has been a battle at Hydrogen
        so pressing the <em>Go To</em> button will pop up the battle visualision dialog
        allowing the battle to be stepped through to see exactly what happened. Here is
        an example of the battle visualisation dialog (basically working but not yet in
        its final form).<br />
