   versions. This means that old save games cannot be loaded
   in this version.

 - Created default races (as close to as currently possible).


Launcher:

 - Removed the ability to resize the launcher window.


Race Wizard:

 - Lesser racial trait "Cheap Engines" now costs points 
   instead of granting them.

   level 3/4.

 - Changed order of tabs to: Race, Traits, Environment,
   Production and Research.

 - Moved "Factories cost 1 less G" to Production tab.

 - Formated primary Racial traits.


Game Play Fixes / GUI:

 - Defenses limited to 100.

 - Fuel calculation now include the mass of the ships, not
   just cargo. (This fix only works for newly created ships
   and is not a retroactive fix for games in progress.)

 - Way points can now be removed with the delete key (once 
   selected). The backspace key also (still) works.

 - Fixed a logic error in VictoryCheck that counted unowned 
   stars as a second player, preventing victory by 
   extermination from being reported.

 - Reworked the invasion angorithm so invasions now work.

 - Unloading colonists at a star not owned by the fleet now
   results in invasion (instead of adding the colonists to 
   the other race's star).

 - Fuel pods and cargo modules now add to the base hull 
   correctly.

 - Corrected conversions of colonists to 
   kilotons-of-colonists.

   designer with another. (Component removal has not yet 
   been implemented.)

 - Fixed incorrect cost when adding 10x components.

 - Mine field is now displayed at correct size. Mine layers
   lay mines continuously.

 - Fixed an issue that caused fuel not to be subtracted for
   legs that took less than 1 whole year/turn.

 - Partial fix to prevent crash when attempting cargo
   transfer where there is nothing to transfer.


Console:

 - Forcing turn generation before any turns are submitted 
   no longer crashes the console.


Component Definitions Fixes:

 - Fixed % chance to hit mines in components.xml.

 - Updated race restrictions form speed trap 20 and orbital 
   construction module in components.xml
   
 - Orbital construction module set to a minimum kill of 2000. 
   Component editor now accepts minimum kill values up to 
   10000.

 - Fixes to components.xml by Coyote: race permision, mining 
   propeties for robo-miners, fixed some images, fixed 
   engines, all bombs now have the proper kill%, Orbital 
   Construction Module now has a bomb property.


Documentation:

 - Updated the Getting Started Guide with command line 
   arguments.

 - Replace font-dependent single character copyright symbol 
   with "(C)" for cross-platform compatibility.


AI:

 - Fixed an issue that caused the AI to crash when run from 
   the command line with incorrect parameters.

   in testing of bombing.) Confirmed smart bombs do bomb.
