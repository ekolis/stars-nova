Whilst the rest of the family slept off the
Christmas Lunch I did a little 'Wormhole
Watching'

This was done in the J Patch RC2 in a Small
Universe where 3 wormhole 'pairs' were observed

The wormhole stability goes in the following scale :

Rock Solid
Stable
Mostly Stable
Average
Slightly Volatile
Volatile
Extremely Volatile

I observed each of the 6 holes through at least one
full 'cycle' each.

I judged a cycle to begin in the year that a wormhole
jumped a significant distance.

In every case (a total of 15 cycles), the year that
the jump occurred, the wormhole gained the status of
'Rock Solid'

In general terms the wormhole gradually decayed from
rock solid through to Extremely volatile, before
jumping to a new location and regaining the rock solid
status.

The most common cycle (8 out of 15) consisted of :

10 or 15 years at Rock Solid
5 years at Stable
5 years at Mostly Stable
5 years at Average
5 years at Slightly Volatile
5 years at Volatile
followed by "a number of" years at Extremely volatile
(anywhere between 1 and 68 years in the tests I did ! )

50% of the wormholes observed spent 10 years at Rock
Solid and 50% spent 15 years at Rock Solid.

The remaining 7 cycles aborted early somewhere between
Stable and Volatile i.e. the wormhole jumped and regained
Rock Solid status before the 'regulation' 5 years had
elapsed at one of the intermediate stabilities

I did not observe any wormhole with a Rock Solid status
making a jump.

Only a small test but some pretty strong patterns have
emerged.

Hope this helps
